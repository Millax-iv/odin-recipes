        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This batter makes light, fluffy, and delicious pancakes. 
            I have been making them for years and everyone that tries them wants the recipe.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk the water and oil together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in the wet. 
                Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, 
                and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. </li>
            <li>Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
